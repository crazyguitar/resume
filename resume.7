.SS Skills

.I Python
Python is one of my favoriate languages because of its elegant syntax. When
I served at Synology Inc., I used Python to write many autotest scripts and
implement a continuous integration system. Furthermore, I create a website,

, to log down many common snippets.
.TP
.I C/C++
I have used C/C++ for 10 years. However, I am still learning these language
because new language features (e.g. C++17) are evolving extremely fast recently
In addition, to better use C/C++, learning related tools such as cmake, GNU
autotools, or LLVM is necessary. Therefore, I can not guarantee that I master
C/C++, but developing projects through C/C++ will not be a serious problem.
.TP
.I Javascript/Nodejs
It is inevitable to use Javascript to develop web applications.
.TP
.I Bash
It is inevitable to write a bash script.
